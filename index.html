            <h1>Nature</h1>
            <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.<br><br>
                    From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a constant basis. Every part of nature – everything from the air to the dirt on the ground – is interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.<br><br>

                    From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources. People cut down trees, mine ores, and grow crops. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.

                <h1>What is nature</h1>
                <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical world, or material world.<br><br> "Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic.<br><br>

                        The term "nature" may refer to living plants and animals, geological processes, weather, and physics, such as matter and energy. The term is often refers to the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general areas that have not been substantially altered by humans, or which persist despite human intervention. <br><br>For, example, manufactured objects and human interaction are generally not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". <br><br>This more traditional concept of "nature" implies a distinction between natural and artificial elements of the Earth, with the artificial as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.</p>

                    <h1>The great thing about nature</h1>
                    <p>Nature is a wonderful thing. We get everything from nature: metal, brick, material. Nature gives us so many things to write about: its life, its warmth and many things more. <br><br>The house you live in and everything in it was once a part of the earth and the clothes you wear come from nature too.<br><br>

                            If you think about it the earth provides everything, back when there was zero fancy technology to modern day society mother nature has always been there to see us through to our most highest ability and survival, I think she at least deserves a thanks for all her work and help. I personally love nature; it gives us much so we are able to thrive on.<br><br> I would like to see more, although to see a tree is sometimes enough for me.<br><br>
                            
                            Another thing about nature is the wonder and beauty it brings. Have you ever seen the sunshine through the richest green leaves on a crisp summer eve or the winking full moon on a late winter night?<br><br> The beauty shines through in many ways, like the blooming blossoms on the trees in spring or the lovely warm colours of autumn, we should take time to just watch and see nature’s beauty. Imagine what the world would be like if we took care of this planet and all of its natural wonders.<br><br> Earth itself is a natural wonder, it is lovely wonderful and exciting and no-one really knows how it came about, no-one knows how it was created exactly we all fantasise what happened and why it’s here and why we’re here on this planet, however until we have the real answer we need to enjoy it and take care of it as much as we can because it provides the basic needs of life.</p>

                        <h1>Summary</h1>
                        <p>Nature helps human beings achieve spiritual growth, meet their material needs, attain aesthetic sentiment, think clearly, and achieve discipline.<br><br>
                            Each of these aspects is explained further in the subsequent chapters. The author also talks about the metaphysics of nature.<br><br>
                            According to him, nature does not have absolute existence because it's not clear whether or not it's a figment of one's imagination.<br><br>
                            However, this fact doesn't matter to the author because he believes that nature in all its beauty and splendor serves a higher purpose for mankind. <br><br></p>
